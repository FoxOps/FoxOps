- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FoxOps, 34 years young from France. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in DevOps, Python, Linux and many other things. I spend my free time homelabing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a Linux Admin and this account is here to showcase my work and study. Not much is currently on it but it may change at anytime.
